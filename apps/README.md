# Apps

Use this directory for runnable phone-call workflow apps, including focused demo apps for MCP, CLI, scheduler, or host integration patterns.

Apps should directly help AI agents schedule, monitor, administer, or safely operate phone-call workflows. This includes focused integration apps for MCP, CLI, scheduler, and host patterns. They are not CALL-E SDKs or supported product APIs.

Use [`../plugins/`](../plugins/) for no-code and low-code workflow-platform nodes, actions, connectors, templates, or recipes.

Current apps:

| App | Language | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`typescript/clarity`](typescript/clarity/) | TypeScript / Next.js | Clarifies one job-application claim with an adaptive CALL-E follow-up, structured results, timestamped transcript evidence, and a synthetic no-call replay. |
| [`typescript/fraud-ops-caller`](typescript/fraud-ops-caller/) | TypeScript / Next.js | Pack-fired fraud-ops desk: KYC, evidence, collections, and merchant intents with a stub dial by default, masked plan destinations, and live CALL-E gated by env + confirm phrase. |
| [`python/audition-agent`](python/audition-agent/) | Python / React | Catalog and setup guide for producer-reviewed CALL-E role-disclosure callbacks, with upstream source and no-call verification. |
| [`typescript/e-mploye-for-calle`](typescript/e-mploye-for-calle/) | TypeScript | Human-approved virtual employee for appointment, lead follow-up, and shift coordination workflows, with a fake-only public mode and opt-in CALL-E SDK integration. |
| [`typescript/asyncfounders`](typescript/asyncfounders/) | TypeScript | Callback-first persistent team memory: consented CALL-E interviews capture updates, brief unseen company deltas, and resolve open questions into evidence-linked typed memory. |
| [`web/fieldclose`](web/fieldclose/) | TypeScript / Next.js | Human-approved commercial HVAC closeout workflow with a fake-only public path, durable recipient suppression, one-attempt duplicate protection, structured CALL-E results, and explicit human disposition. |
| [`typescript/kincall`](typescript/kincall/) | TypeScript | Consent-first check-in and trusted-circle coordination: a stated request for help overrides the agent's own judgement, contacts are called one at a time until somebody commits, and the monitored person is called back with the outcome. |
| [`typescript/revisit-zero`](typescript/revisit-zero/) | TypeScript | Controlled meter-access recovery workbench with deterministic safety gates, exact call approval, one-recipient CALL-E execution, strict structured-result validation, and human-approved rebook export. |
| [`typescript/verify-contact-claim`](typescript/verify-contact-claim/) | TypeScript | Contact-claim verifier for a suspicious voicemail, text or missed call: dials only the number printed on the customer's own card, asks whether that contact was genuine and returns the words that came back with a hash-chained record. |
| [`typescript/call-neuron`](typescript/call-neuron/) | TypeScript | Functional consent-first scholarship outreach prototype with manual/file intake, identity-first disclosure, neutral voicemail, one-recipient CALL-E planning and confirmation, live status, human dispositions, and browser-local campaign data. |
| [`typescript/hirecall`](typescript/hirecall/) | TypeScript | Recruiter screening desk for internship and junior hiring: Excel batches, Gemini-written CALL-E scripts, sequential calls, post-call scoring, and a dry-run no-call path by default. |
| [`typescript/phone-approval-gate`](typescript/phone-approval-gate/) | TypeScript | Phone-verified approval gate for irreversible automation, with a one-time spoken code, an escalation ladder, dual control and a verifiable approval record. |
| [`typescript/voice-preflight`](typescript/voice-preflight/) | TypeScript | Renders a call task through any text-to-speech API you already pay for so you hear it before the callee does, then refuses a script whose declared critical line has gone missing, whose voice cannot speak the recipient's language or whose measured audio overruns its budget. |
| [`typescript/call-on-behalf`](typescript/call-on-behalf/) | TypeScript | Delegated errand caller with a disclosure budget: says only the details the person authorized, commits only inside authorized windows, and returns the answers plus the transcript. |
| [`python/leash`](python/leash/) | Python | Revokes an unattended agent's Google credential unless one call clears twelve conditions; silence, a machine answering, or a result that disagrees with its own transcript all end the lease. |
| [`python/hungrycall-cascade`](python/hungrycall-cascade/) | Python | Sequential call cascade that stops at the first candidate meeting every must and boundary, with staged concessions treated as an authorisation and unknown outcomes halting the run. |
| [`python/researchcall-survey`](python/researchcall-survey/) | Python | Standardized survey runner with a reproducible seeded sample, locked ethics rules, raw answers kept beside their coded category, and completion measured against everyone drawn. |
| [`python/ringedingeding`](python/ringedingeding/) | Python | Multi-recipient response aggregator that keeps answered, refused and unreached apart, reports every share against those who answered, and never reads silence as consent. |
| [`typescript/multi-party-scheduler`](typescript/multi-party-scheduler/) | TypeScript | Two-phase appointment scheduling over phone calls: gather availability, confirm one time with everybody by voice, release everybody who confirmed when the commit fails and resume an interrupted run. |
| [`python/callback-coordinator`](python/callback-coordinator/) | Python | Consent-first callback triage and routing: one CALL-E call learns why a person needs a callback, classifies the outcome into a fail-closed disposition, and routes it to the right team. |
| [`python/callback-window-coordinator`](python/callback-window-coordinator/) | Python | Consent-first callback-window coordinator with masked preview, stable idempotency, and structured CALL-E results. |
| [`python/callback-scam-screener`](python/callback-scam-screener/) | Python | Screens a callback-scam phone number from a suspicious email by having CALL-E dial it first, transparently as an AI, and score the transcript against a scam-signal checklist — preview-by-default, a dev/test dial allowlist, one screening call per number, and configurable daily call/LLM-spend caps, all enforced in code. |
| [`python/webhook-result-receiver`](python/webhook-result-receiver/) | Python | Durable at-least-once CALL-E terminal webhook ingestion with SQLite deduplication, conflict detection, and authenticated Calls API reconciliation. |
| [`python/mobilize`](python/mobilize/) | Python | Parallel wave dispatch to a consented pool under a deadline: stops calling the moment enough people confirm, and scores how firm each "yes" actually is instead of trusting every stated agreement. Ships a 300-trial zero-cost evaluation harness with a measured accuracy result, a crash-safe ledger, and an MCP server. |
| [`python/refcheck-ai`](python/refcheck-ai/) | Python | Employment reference checks where the question template compiles into a CALL-E `result_schema`, so extraction and validation happen server-side with no second LLM; unsigned terminal webhooks are de-duplicated and re-verified against the Calls API, and an unanswered question is recorded as missing evidence instead of a neutral score. |
| [`python/batch-runner`](python/batch-runner/) | Python | JSONL batch runner using CALL-E CLI auth state, FastMCP, Rich output, and MCP tool-call metadata. |
| [`python/broker-login-client`](python/broker-login-client/) | Python | CALL-E brokered login client with local token cache and MCP HTTP calls. |
| [`typescript/broker-login-client`](typescript/broker-login-client/) | TypeScript | CALL-E brokered login client using `@call-e/core`. |
| [`typescript/broker-login-client-standalone`](typescript/broker-login-client-standalone/) | TypeScript | CALL-E brokered login client without a shared package dependency. |
| [`python/oauth-login-client`](python/oauth-login-client/) | Python | CALL-E OAuth login client for MCP Streamable HTTP. |
| [`typescript/oauth-login-client`](typescript/oauth-login-client/) | TypeScript | CALL-E OAuth login client for MCP Streamable HTTP. |
| [`typescript/vibehub-founder-relay`](typescript/vibehub-founder-relay/) | TypeScript | Consent-first founder-match readiness call with masked preview, stable idempotency, and structured CALL-E results. |
| [`typescript/openings`](typescript/openings/) | TypeScript | Standing availability watch for care access: calls the healthcare providers actually listed in directories to verify who is real, who takes your plan, and who has an opening, then keeps watching on a decaying cadence until a slot opens. |
| [`typescript/ringer`](typescript/ringer/) | TypeScript | Consumer web app that turns dreaded phone tasks — bill negotiation, cancellations, bookings, refunds, and multi-business quote comparison — into consent-first, multilingual CALL-E workflows with strict per-call and per-recipient result schemas, human-in-the-loop decision authority, evidence-gated and denominator-honest outcomes, and a no-call demo mode by default. |
| [`web/local-atlas`](web/local-atlas/) | JavaScript / Node | Map-first local guide where one confirmed call becomes a dated, evidence-quoted fact every later visitor reuses: stored answers, opinion refusal, closed-business and calling-window checks all work to avoid placing a call at all, results keep their uncertainty and expire by outcome, and private results are written where the public list cannot read them. A comparison across two or three nearby places is one multi-recipient task, with each business answering for itself and the cross-call verdict marked as derived rather than quoted. |
| [`python/ringdown`](python/ringdown/) | Python | On-call escalation agent that phones the pager holder one rung at a time, treats a call as acknowledged only when an owner and an ETA are each quoted by a span the recipient spoke, re-reads its own call over a second transport, and seals every verdict in a hash-chained ledger that re-derives the verdict on replay. |
| [`python/kept`](python/kept/) | Python | Turns a payment promise made on a collections call into a validated financial record: eleven named rejection reasons stand between a spoken sentence and a ledger entry, vague amounts are refused, over-commitments are clamped to the invoice balance with the spoken figure kept beside them, and the promise is reconciled against the bank feed a week later so only the commitments that actually broke are called again. |
| [`typescript/callsweep`](typescript/callsweep/) | TypeScript | Calls many local businesses, haggles each one down toward your budget on the call, ranks their offers by the best overall deal (price, what's included, availability), and books the one you pick. Dry-run no-call path by default with fictional sample shops. |
| [`python/casechaser`](python/casechaser/) | Python | Chases an open claim, refund, repair, or delivery case to closure: every company promise becomes a dated, quoted commitment, broken ones climb a fixed escalation ladder, offers and denials stop at the customer, and a masked evidence pack is ready for the written complaint. Fixture mode by default. |
| [`python/agency-status-watch`](python/agency-status-watch/) | Python | Recurring status watch for phone-only government application files: CALL-E navigates the agency's published IVR, reads back the status of your own application by reference number, and returns it as structured JSON, re-checking on a decaying cadence until terminal, action-required, or budget spent. Fixture-first with a consent-gated live path. |

- [OneReach service follow-up](typescript/onereach-service-followup/) - Standalone Node.js CALL-E appointment workflow with a no-call default, validated outcomes, and signed webhook handling.
